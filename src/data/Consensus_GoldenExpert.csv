Bud scales dull reddish tan. Smoothish bark with some horizontal, lighter-colored patches, thus presenting a mottled and/or cross-streaked effect. Near base of trunk were relatively few fissures which were rather remote from each other. Branches, which began at ca. 4 ft., were hardly numerous; hence the tree was not dense-foliaged. Ascending to more or less horizontally spreading, the branches showed little or no tendency to bend down peripherally. Diam. at 2 ft. was ca. 6-7 in. About 25 ft. tall and 20 ft. across.
